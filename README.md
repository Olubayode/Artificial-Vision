# Artificial-Vision
The eye is perhaps the most important sensory organ in the human body, not just
because it can capture the view of our environment but because of the visual
cortex which interpret what the eyes captures.  
They collectively enable pattern recognition with
stunning accuracy and unprecedented efficiency. 
The eyes act as a camera and the visual cortex acts as the intelligence unit.
Computer vision is a field of study devoted to teaching computers how to
recognize patterns and understand what these patterns represent. My project was designed to Capturing
videos and performing pattern recognition, using the intelligence layer that interpret what the camera captures. Hence, the focus of
this book is not to teach the reader to create better cameras but to improve the
intelligence layer in providing visual awareness to the blind.
So this project
